#**Liri Node App:**#

This is an app that can be used through Node in your terminal. There are four set commands with instruction of what to include with the command in parentheses:
* concert-this (artist name)
* spotify-this-song (song name)
* movie-this (movie name)
* do-what-it-says (picks a random input for you)

Based on the command and input the app calls the relevant API to pull the information. The information console.logs to the terminal screen and is also appended to the log.txt file. The fourth command pulls the text from the random.txt file and runs the command and input.

##This app uses the following:##
* FS
* Axios
* Moment.js
* Bands in Town API
* Spotify API
* OMDB API

Here is a screen recording of each command in order: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PAZE60KBpOsvBkzj-66oqoLIGiLmfO_s/view?usp=sharing
